    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
    <p>Copyright Â©2002 by David Matuszek</p>
    <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p>
    <p>The usual <em>scenario</em> is that you are faced with a <i>number</i> of options, and you must choose one of these. After you make your choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final state.
         If you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is a goal state; if you didn't, it isn't.</p>
    <p>Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beginning with the root, 
        you choose one of its children to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf.</p>
    <p>Suppose you get to a
         bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your 
         most recent <strong>choice</strong>, and trying out the next <b>option</b> in that set of options. If you run out of options, 
         revoke the <strike>choice that got you here,</strike>  and <sub>try</sub> another choice <sup>at</sup> that node. If you end up at the root with
          no options left, <ins>there</ins> are no <del>good</del> leaves to be found.
    </p>
    <p>This needs an example.</p>

        <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>
        <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li>
        <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>
        <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>
        <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
        <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li>
        <li>E is good. Congratulations!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of choices we could make. There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to tell us what choices we have.
    (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching.)

    <h2>The backtracking algorithm.</h2>
    <p>Here is the algorithm (in pseudocode) for doing backtracking from a given node n:</p>
    <pre>
        boolean solve(Node n) {
            if n is a leaf node {
                if the leaf is a goal node, return true
                else return false
            } else {
                for each child c of n {
                    if solve(c) succeeds, return true
                }
                return false
            }
        }
    
    </pre>
    
    
    <code>
        boolean solve(Node n) {
            if n is a leaf node {
                if the leaf is a goal node, return true
                else return false
            } else {
                for each child c of n {
                    if solve(c) succeeds, return true
                }
                return false
            }
        }
